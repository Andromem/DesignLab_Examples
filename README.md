These are the example projects and libraries for DesignLab.

They are a separate project to make it easy to download the examples without downloading the full DesignLab source code.

To use you should go to File/Preferences in DesignLab and set the Sketchbook location to this DesignLab_Examples folder.
You will also need to rename the libraries folder in your DesignLab installation to libraries-orig so you don't pick up two copies of the libraries.
