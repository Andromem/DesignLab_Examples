Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:1186 - One or more I/O components have conflicting property values.
    For each occurrence, the system will use the property value attached to the
   pad.  Otherwise, the system will use the first property value read.  To view
   each occurrence, create a detailed map report (run map using the -detail
   option).

WARNING:Timing:3402 - The Clock Modifying COMP, XLXI_39/clkgen_inst/DCM_inst_1mhz, has the attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to NONE.  No phase
   relationship exists between the input and output clocks of this Clock Modifying COMP. Data paths between these clock domains must be
   constrained using FROM/TO constraints.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
